# Deconstruct-Reconstruct-Web-Report

### Instructions followed:

- Part I – Choose your data visualisation
Find a problematic data visualisation on the web such that:

The visualisation has multiple issues that you can fix or improve. These issues can relate to one or more of the following:
Ethical issues
Issues with data integrity
Perceptual or colour issues
The data visualisation is based on real data and includes variables that are sufficient to produce an interesting data visualisation. 

- Part II – Deconstruct
Identify the objective of the data visualisation and the target audience. 
Narrow down the issues to the three most significant problems that could be improved or fixed. You must have three. No more, no less. 
Using the dot points in the template, very briefly explain each of the issues identified. 

- Part III – Reconstruct
Source the original data or data as close as possible to the original.
Use ggplot2 to reconstruct a data visualisation to fix the problems you identified and realise the objective.
Reference your data source/s.
